# SCalcP
Simple Python Calculator made using tkinter GUI module/lib

This project was done to get a better understanding of how I could use external modules in my projects. The project itself was quick and what made this interesting was the fact that I never programmed a GUI so developing the UI was interesting.

The skills I picked up in this projected served me well in my future projects.
